# Vehicle App

A simple flutter application to display a list of vehicles. Any vehicle that gives 15km/litre or above and 5 year old or less is considered to be fuel efficient and low pollutant. This vehicle will have a green color coding. 15km/litre or above but older than 5 year will be fuel efficient, but moderately pollutant. These vehicles will have amber color coding. Cars other than the two conditions else will be red colored.
